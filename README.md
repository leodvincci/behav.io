### Question Bank
- The app includes a small bank of commonly asked behavioral questions in software engineering interviews. These questions are categorized based on different skills such as problem-solving, communication, teamwork, leadership, etc.

### Timer
- The app includes a simple timer feature that allows users to set a specific time limit for their responses to each question. This feature helps simulate the pressure of a real interview.

### Recording Feature
- The app allows users to record their responses to each question using their device's microphone. This feature helps users review their performance and identify areas for improvement.

### Feedback
- The app provides feedback on the quality of the responses based on a set of predefined criteria. The feedback could be in the form of a score or simple comments. This feature helps users understand their strengths and weaknesses in answering behavioral questions.

### Mock Interview
